> My first assembler and interpreter applications.

## Example

```asm
# Output "Hello" in console
HELLO_WORLD:

 LDA #72
 LDX #$A000
 STA ,X

 LDA #101
 LDX #$A002
 STA ,X

 LDA #108
 LDX #$A004
 STA ,X

 LDA #108
 LDX #$A006
 STA ,X

 LDA #111
 LDX #$A008
 STA ,X

 END HELLO_WORLD
```


After assembling the code above, when running it, the following result will appear:

## Assembler


Converts the assembly code in byte-code.

```sh
$ ./Assembler/Assembler/bin/Debug/Assembler.exe input-file.asm output-file.biz
```

## Interpreter


Interprets the byte-code and shows the result in the console.

```sh
$ ./BizMachineGUI/BizMachineGUI/bin/Debug/BizMachineGUI.exe output-file.biz
```

## :sparkling_heart: Support my projects

I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,
this takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications *for free*! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).

However, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it:

 - Starring and sharing the projects you like :rocket:
 - [![Buy me a book][badge_amazon]][amazon]—I love books! I will remember you after years if you buy me one. :grin: :book:
 - [![PayPal][badge_paypal]][paypal-donations]—You can make one-time donations via PayPal. I'll probably buy a ~~coffee~~ tea. :tea:
 - [![Support me on Patreon][badge_patreon]][patreon]—Set up a recurring monthly donation and you will get interesting news about what I'm doing (things that I don't share with everyone).
 - **Bitcoin**—You can send me bitcoins at this address (or scanning the code below): `1P9BRsmazNQcuyTxEqveUsnf5CERdq35V6`
